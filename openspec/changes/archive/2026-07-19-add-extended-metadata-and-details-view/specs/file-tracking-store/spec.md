## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Persistent per-file tracking record
The system SHALL persist one record per discovered audio file — path, format, fingerprint, size, modification time, identification status (`new`, `identified`, `not_found`, `missing`), and, once identified, resolved artist, album artist, title, track number, release year, disc number, total discs, total tracks, and MusicBrainz recording/release/release-group/artist IDs — in an embedded SQLite database that survives process restarts.

#### Scenario: Tracking data survives a restart
- **WHEN** the server process is restarted after files have been tracked
- **THEN** previously tracked files and their status SHALL still be retrievable without re-scanning `/music`

#### Scenario: Resolved metadata survives a restart
- **WHEN** the server process is restarted after a file has been identified
- **THEN** that file's resolved artist, album artist, title, track number, release year, disc number, total discs, total tracks, and MusicBrainz IDs SHALL still be retrievable without re-running identification

### Requirement: Identification results are recorded per file
The system SHALL update a tracked file's record with the outcome of an identification attempt, without altering its fingerprint, size, or modification time.

#### Scenario: Identification succeeds
- **WHEN** identification resolves a match for a tracked file
- **THEN** the system SHALL set that file's status to `identified` and store its resolved artist, album artist, title, track number, release year, disc number, total discs, total tracks, and MusicBrainz recording/release/release-group/artist IDs

#### Scenario: Identification finds no match
- **WHEN** identification finds no AcoustID match for a tracked file
- **THEN** the system SHALL set that file's status to `not_found` and SHALL NOT write any resolved metadata fields

#### Scenario: Identification fails due to a gateway error
- **WHEN** an AcoustID or MusicBrainz request fails during identification of a tracked file
- **THEN** the system SHALL leave that file's status and metadata unchanged and SHALL surface the error separately from the file's tracked state

#### Scenario: Missing release year does not block identification
- **WHEN** identification resolves a match whose release has no usable date
- **THEN** the system SHALL still record the file as `identified` with its other resolved fields, leaving the release year unset
